### Chapter 1: The Boy Who uses PhpStorm

Yes, another opportunity to hone my front end skills creating a parallax!
The parallax has some kind of magic effect when you see it in action, for those muggles at least.
I think it would be fun to use Harry Potter as a theme for this project. 
First I'll have to find some nice imagery and think about the effect I want to create.
Oh, I'll be using PhpStorm instead of Visual Studio Code as my IDE for this project as well. 
I've been wanting to switch up my IDE for a couple of weeks now and today is the day!

“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.”

— Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 37

## Chapter 2: Hogwarts under construction

Searching for Harry Potter images was quite time absorbing and still not happy with what I found so far.
Hogwarts is therefore placed in a state of "Under construction". I wanted to start working so I created the parallax 
functionality with the images provided by the coaches. This saved me some time as these images can be layered
a lot easier. The images will be altered afterwards, for now we can already spot the flying weasley car.
My next challenge will be to get this car moving/flying across the screen. Really enjoying PhpStorm so far
and can see the advantages over visual studio code quite easily. Will have to keep working with it in future projects
to really get more fluid and discover even more things about it.
