### Chapter 1: The Boy Who uses PhpStorm

Yes, another opportunity to hone my front end skills creating a parallax!
The parallax has some kind of magic effect when you see it in action, for those muggles at least.
I think it would be fun to use Harry Potter as a theme for this project. 
First I'll have to find some nice imagery and think about the effect I want to create.
Oh, I'll be using PhpStorm instead of Visual Studio Code as my IDE for this project as well. 
I've been wanting to switch up my IDE for a couple of weeks now and today is the day!

“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.”
